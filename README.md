# Voice Driven Automation Builder (VDAB) üîâ

Welcome to **Voice Driven Automation Builder (VDAB)**, the revolutionary tool that transforms voice commands into automation workflows! In this README, you'll find everything you need to know about setting up and using our project, as well as our technology stack, core features, and future plans.

## Overview

VDAB is designed to streamline workflow creation by allowing users to build process diagrams through voice dictation. This makes automation easier and more intuitive, allowing teams to quickly develop automated processes with minimal manual input. VDAB leverages Generative AI to interpret voice commands and create corresponding process diagrams, ultimately leading to automation workflows using available automation bots.

## Problem Statement

Creating automation workflows can be complex, often requiring significant time and technical expertise. VDAB aims to simplify this process by allowing users to build automation workflows simply by speaking. This eliminates the need for complex software interfaces and extensive manual input, leading to increased productivity and accessibility.

## Core Features

- **Voice Dictation**: Create process diagrams by speaking into the system, allowing for hands-free workflow creation. üé§
- **Generative AI**: Uses AI to interpret voice commands and translate them into process diagrams. üß†
- **Automation Workflow Generation**: Automatically generate automation workflows from process diagrams. ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Integration with Automation Bots**: Build workflows using existing automation bots for seamless integration with your infrastructure. ü§ñ
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive user interface for ease of use and accessibility. üíª
